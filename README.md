# example-module
This is an example CJR module. 

# Scripts
If your module requires a script to be run after the repository is cloned, you must add a `postinstall.sh` script to the root folder of your repository. This file must have execute permissions as PCJR will not do this for you.

# Distribution
To add the repository to Moduland, navigate to    

    https://moduland.ml/add_pkg/<pkg_name>/<github_username>/<repository_name>

For this package, the url was:
https://moduland.ml/add_pkg/example-module/CJR-Org/example-module

Note: this is very temporary.
